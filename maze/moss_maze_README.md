Hi there!

If you want to use my maze:
* Import my maze (import moss_maze)
* Initialise an instance of it --> (maze = moss_maze.Maze())
* str(that instance) --> (str(maze))
and boom you have the maze
Alternatively, you can do this:
* Import my maze
* string = moss_maze.Maze().generate_obstacles()

* an obstacle is represented as 'xx'
* an open space is represented by '  '
